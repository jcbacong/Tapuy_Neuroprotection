# Tapuy_Neuroprotection

This github repo contains the codes used in the paper entitled "Tapuy lees extracts protect transgenic Caenorhabditis elegans from short-term neuronal decline due to glyphosate-induced neurotoxicity". It includes the autosegmentation script in `ImageJ` that detects neurons from fluoresence images as well as a `Python` script that collates and cleans the outputs from ImageJ. It also includes the `R` script for the statistical analysis and visualization for each assay conducted in the study.
